QuickOps is a Python library designed to make common list and string operations easy and intuitive. It provides a collection of classes and methods for manipulating lists and strings, including merging, finding sum of variable pairs, and finding the longest substring without repeating characters.  The library is designed to be lightweight and easy to use. It includes three main classes: ListOperator, StringOperator, and ListStringOperator. The ListOperator class provides methods for merging two sorted lists and finding pairs of variables that add up to a given target. The StringOperator class provides a method for finding the longest substring without repeating characters. The ListStringOperator class provides a wrapper around both ListOperator and StringOperator, allowing users to work with both lists and strings in a unified way.  HelloQuick is an example file that demonstrates the usage of QuickOps. It includes examples of merging two sorted lists, finding pairs of variables that add up to a given target, and finding the longest substring without repeating characters. The examples are simple and easy to understand, making it a great starting point for new users of the library. I will add more as I go along.
